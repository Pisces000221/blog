#### Q&A About Me

##### What are your favourite things to do? Why?

When talking about my favourite things to do, it always goes to programming. Developing new softwares for everyone has long been my task and goal in my future career. I love it because I found it fascinating in a lot of ways, as computer languages are hard to understand but the binary software is easy to use, isn't it amazing?

##### What do you want to be when you grow up? Why?

As I've said before, I want to be a programmer at Google in the future. I found working in Google interesting and therefore I can learn about how the top developers in the world code in their real work. By greatly improving myself, hopefully, I will become the top coders in the world one day.

##### What is your favourite subject in school? Why?

My favourite is definitely physics of course. Physics is a subject based on real life experiment, in other words, it is a subject to explain all those marvellous phenomenon in our world. It is so attractive when oneself is involved in the explanation and development of a new naturallaw or equation. It feels great!

##### What skills or talents do you have? Dancing? Music? Sports?

Besides coding, I love playing guitar and basketball. As for guitar, I'vebeen learning and playing this for more than 7 years. And basketball,I'm currently a member of our school basketball team
