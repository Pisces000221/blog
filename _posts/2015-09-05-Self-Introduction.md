#### Welcome to my Self-Intro!

##### Brief Intro on PAtrick W
Dating back to years ago when I was a young kid, I had great interest in computers. Therefore, I spent tons of time learning computer-programming language and have developed a number of projects. I can currently operate [Delphi](http://magetron.github.io/NOIP-openjudge/), [Objective-C together with Swift](https://github.com/magetron/TravelWeatherGuide), [C++](https://github.com/magetron/Fruit-cpp-extension) and [JavaScript](http://magetron.github.io/2048-AI/) to build projects on both PCs and Macs, and I’m still learning Swift, the latest expansion of Objective-C to make myself better in programing.

Currently, I’m enrolled in [Apple Developer Program using Xcode to build cool apps for App Store and my first ever iOS project is on the go](https://github.com/magetron/TravelWeatherGuide). Apart from being a developer on mac, I have also been playing an active role in the Microsoft Insider Program to give out the latest test reports as well a seek out those bugs exist in the latest Windows 10 Technical Preview, thus days ago I have received the invitation of exploring Microsoft World Headquarters to learn more deeply about the NT Kernel and the Operating System.

Despite my love for coding, building cool devices is also one of my dreams. Meanwhile, I have been constantly sending feedbacks to Google as well as [developing the localized Chinese operating system with the GlassX team to help shape the future of the Project Glass Program](http://www.glassx.cn/chinese_rom).

At the same time, I’m a man of great passion on contributing open-source projects especially Chromium on platforms including but not only on GitHub.

Lastly, [Unreal Engine](https://github.com/magetron/UnrealEngine) and [Cry Engine game development](https://github.com/magetron/CryEngine3_rc.extension) is the part I’ve been learning, such that I believe I can improve myself in using modeling softwares to build CG s and Gameplay demos using the latest engines.

In all, I’m a guy of great passion to learn all cool stuffs about computers so as to make myself much better prepared for my college life and my career as well.
